This repository contains an implementation of `storage.BlobStore` of the Storj storagenodes.

This is just an experiment. It's slower than the default file-based one, and if you don't know what is it, you probably don't need it anyway.

Limitations:
 * Some parts are not yet implemented
 * Trash functionality is definitelly not implemented
 * Size calculation is 'estimation' based
